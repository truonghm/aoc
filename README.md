# Advent of Code Solutions

1. Run solution:

```
# python solve.py --day=<day> --year=<year>
```

`<day>` can be formatted as __DD__ or __D__. `<year>` is formatted as __YYYY__. 


2. Add solutions: Add to appropriate directories: For example, the solution for the first day of 2022 is located at [./solutions/aoc2022/s202201.py](./solutions/aoc2022/s202201.py).

3. Save input: Download and save manually at [./input](./input/). Follow the naming convention of previous input files (`input/YYYY/input_YYYYMM.txt`)
